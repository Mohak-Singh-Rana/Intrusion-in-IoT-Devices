# Intrusion in IoT Devices

**Undergraduate Project under Prof. Priyanka Bagade, Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur**

This repository contains the work done for the project "Intrusion in IoT Devices". The project focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in Bluetooth communication and developing an effective Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to address these issues.


## Objectives
- **Exploit Bluetooth Communication Vulnerabilities:** Investigate the weaknesses in Bluetooth communication protocols to understand potential security threats.
- **Develop Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** Create an effective IDS to detect and mitigate intrusion attempts based on identified vulnerabilities.

## Key Activities
- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attack:**
  - Utilized `Bluetooth-DOS-Script` to perform DoS attacks.
  - Analyzed packet capture (pcap) files using Wireshark to study the impact of the attack.

- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:**
  - Conducted MITM attacks using `Btlejuice` to set up an attackerâ€™s host and proxy.
  - Performed on-the-fly data breaches to test the effectiveness of security measures.
